To ensure fair contribution and collaborative integrity within groups, all members are expected to fulfill their assigned 
roles as outlined in the Work Distribution Matrix. If a member consistently fails to complete their assigned tasks, the 
group must first attempt to resolve the issue through clear, documented internal communication. 
If the issue persists, the group is required to notify the course instructor or facilitator with supporting evidence (e.g., 
chat logs, Git commits, progress summaries). The instructor may then take one or more of the following actions: 
●  Individual grade adjustment based on documented contribution. 
●  Exclusion from the group if no remediation is possible 
The remaining members must absorb the remaining work or redistribute with instructor approval. False reporting of 
the distribution of work may be treated as academic misconduct, resulting in a grade of zero or a disciplinary 
referral. 
 
 
Checking 
Project checking and demonstrations will be conducted with multiple groups simultaneously to assess 
interoperability, correctness, and compliance with the protocol specification. Each group must ensure their 
implementation functions correctly in a networked environment alongside others, as this setup reflects realistic use 
cases. Groups are expected to actively participate during checking and be able to explain and troubleshoot their 
contributions. Failure to perform during this stage may affect the final grade.
